Aminath knows this all too well. As the environment and climate change minister for the Maldives, 
she is part of a community of politicians and scientists trying to work out how quickly sea levels will rise, 
if this can be slowed and what it means for us all. In some places, new ways of holding back the tide may buy us a few decades. 
Elsewhere, this won''t be possible. We are facing a disaster unfolding in slow motion. Responding effectively means a sea change in the way we think. â€¦',

Plants rely on a process called carbon fixation -- turning carbon dioxide from the air into carbon-rich biomolecules - for their very existence. 
That''s the whole point of photosynthesis, and a cornerstone of the vast interlocking system that cycles carbon through plants,

I''ve been a physician for 20 years now, and a strong proponent of lifestyle medicine for much of it. 
I know that it''s hard to make lasting, healthy lifestyle changes, even when people know what to do and have the means to do it.

that can help make long-lasting healthy lifestyle changes happen.',
